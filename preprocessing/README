Before running the preprocessing code make sure you:
1) Create a "BRATS_2015" folder that will be used to store the Training and Testing data folders
2) Create a "Project" folder containing the aforementioned "BRATS_2015" folder in it
3) Extract the BRATS_2015_Training dataset to a folder named Training
4) Extract the BRATS_2015_Testing dataset to a folder named Testing
5) Move the newly created Training and Testing folders to the BRATS_2015 folder inside of the Project folder
3) Place "Preprocessing.ipynb" in project folder and run

You only need to run the preprocessing code (main) once. Please review the normalized output.
The preprocessing code produces 4-Channel-Patches and  corresponding label images which can be used directly in a NN for image segmentation.
These can be found in the "Patches/" and "CNN_Labels/" subdirectories created after running the Preprocessing script.

* Preprocessing code was generated based on the work shared in https://github.com/naldeborgh7575/brain_segmentation with 
* significant modifications.
