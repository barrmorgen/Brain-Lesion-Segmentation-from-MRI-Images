Before running the preprocessing code make sure you:
1) create a "BRATS_2015" folder for the Training and Testing data folders
2) create a "project" folder containing the "BRATS_2015" folder in it
3) create "Labels" and "Norm_PNG" folders in the project folder (assuming we are normalizing the data)

You only need to run the preprocessing code (main) once. Please review the normalized output

* Preprocessing code was generated based on the work shared in https://github.com/naldeborgh7575/brain_segmentation
