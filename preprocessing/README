Before running the preprocessing code make sure you:
1) create a "BRATS_2015" folder for the Training and Testing data folders
2) create a "project" folder containing the "BRATS_2015" folder in it

You only need to run the preprocessing code (main) once. Please review the normalized output
The preprocessing code produces Patches and labels which can be used directly in NN for image segmentation

* Preprocessing code was generated based on the work shared in https://github.com/naldeborgh7575/brain_segmentation with significant modifications
