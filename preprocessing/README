Before running the preprocessing code make sure you:
1) create a "BRATS_2015" folder for the Training and Testing data folders
2) create a "project" folder containing the "BRATS_2015" folder in it
3) Place "Preprocessing.ipynb" in project folder and run

You only need to run the preprocessing code (main) once. Please review the normalized output.
The preprocessing code produces 4-Channel-Patches and  corresponding label images which can be used directly in a NN for image segmentation.
These can be found in the "Patches/" and "CNN_Labels/" subdirectories created after running the Preprocessing script.

* Preprocessing code was generated based on the work shared in https://github.com/naldeborgh7575/brain_segmentation with 
* significant modifications.
